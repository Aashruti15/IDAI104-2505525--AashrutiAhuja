# IDAI104-2505525--AashrutiAhuja
A powerful aerospace analytics platform to explore 48 mission datasets, simulate rocket trajectories using Newtonian physics, and uncover data-driven insights through interactive charts and filters.


# Project Overview
The Rocket Launch Path and Mission Intelligence dashboard is a Streamlit web application that displays and simulates rocket missions based on both formatted missions and physics-based modeling.
The project incorporates the data analytics, mathematical modeling, and interactive visualization to identify the relationship between various parameters of the mission: payload weight, fuel consumption, cost, mission duration, and launch vehicle and their effects on the performance and success of the rockets.
Besides the mission data analysis, the application has a rocket ascent simulation model which relies on the Second Law of Motion as developed by Newton. Parameters that can be changed by the user include thrust, payload, drag coefficient, and fuel, to monitor the influence of these parameters to the behavior of altitude, velocity, and trajectory in real-time.
The project will show how mathematics, physics, and data science can be used in aerospace analytics.
